# DAG Longest Path

Given the adjacency list of a **DAG** (Directed Acyclic Graph) with edge weights, `graph`, and a node, `start`, return an array of length V (the number of nodes) with the length of the longest path from start to every other node (or -infinity if the node is unreachable). The edge weights can be **negative**.

---

## Example

```
graph = [
  [[1, 10]],                    # Neighbors of node 0
  [],                           # Neighbors of node 1
  [[1, 10]],                    # Neighbors of node 2
  [[4, 12]],                    # Neighbors of node 3
  [[1, 11], [2, 21], [5, 14]],  # Neighbors of node 4
  [[2, -30]]                    # Neighbors of node 5
]
start = 4
Output: [infinity, -6, -16, infinity, 0, 14]
Nodes 0 and 3 are unreachable from node 4.
ode 4 is at distance 0 from itself.
The shortest path from node 4 to node 1 is 4 -> 5 -> 2 -> 1.

Constraints:

- The number of nodes is at most `10^5`
- The number of edges is at most `10^6`
- Each node is labeled from `0` to `V-1`
- The edge weights are integers between `-10^4` and `10^4`

```
